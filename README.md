# Inverted_Pendulum

This repository contains three different versions of a simplified inverted pendulum problem implemented using
fuzzy logic. The examples employ the Mamdani Inference System. The membership functions used are triangle, 
trapezoid and bell shaped. The programs use the fuzzy logic toolkit for python called scikit-fuzzy. To install
run pip install -U scikit-fuzzy.
